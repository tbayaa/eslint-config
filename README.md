# eslint-config-bayzat

This package provides bayzat's .eslintrc as an extensible [shareable config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs.html).

## Usage

Our default export contains all of our ESLint rules, including EcmaScript 6+.

1. `npm install --save-dev bitbucket:bayzat/eslint-config `
git+ssh://git@github.com/tbayaa/eslint-config.git
2. add it to your `.eslintrc` file

```json
{
  "extends": "eslint-config-bayzat"
}

```

## Editors

If you want to use this config with your favourite code editor you will probably need to install this config globally into your system library.

`npm install --global git+ssh://git@github.com/tbayaa/eslint-config.git`

See the [ESlint config docs](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files)
for more information.

## Improving this config

Consider adding test cases if you're making complicated rules changes, like
anything involving regexes. Perhaps in a distant future, we could use literate
programming to structure our README as test cases for our .eslintrc?

You can make sure this module lints with itself using `npm run lint`.
It will also fix the found issues if possible.
